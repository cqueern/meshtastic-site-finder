# Meshtastic Site Finder

**Meshtastic Site Finder** is a lightweight web application for identifying, mapping, and evaluating potential locations for Meshtastic nodes—especially fixed, solar-powered, or infrastructure-mounted deployments.

The goal is to help communities build **more resilient, better-placed Meshtastic networks** by making it easier to visualize geography, elevation, and existing structures that are well-suited for long-range LoRa mesh coverage.

---

## What This Is

Meshtastic Site Finder is designed to answer questions like:

- *Where should I put a fixed Meshtastic node to maximize coverage?*
- *Which tall structures could host a solar-powered relay?*
- *How can a community coordinate node placement instead of guessing?*

It focuses on **site discovery and planning**, not device configuration or live network telemetry.

## Core Features

- 🗺️ **Interactive Map**
  - Pan and zoom to explore candidate locations
  - Designed for desktop and tablet use

- 🏗️ **Structure-Oriented Discovery**
  - Emphasis on tall, prominent, or infrastructure-adjacent locations
  - Suitable for solar, rooftop, or mast-mounted nodes

- 📍 **Community-Friendly Planning**
  - Helps groups coordinate placement decisions
  - Useful for clubs, emergency communications groups, and local mesh builders

- ⚡ **Lightweight & Static**
  - Runs entirely in the browser
  - Can be hosted cheaply (or free) on static hosting

## What This Is *Not*

To set expectations clearly:

- ❌ Not a live Meshtastic network monitor  
- ❌ Not a replacement for Meshtastic firmware, apps, or radios  
- ❌ Not a guarantee that a location is deployable or permitted  
- ❌ Not authoritative infrastructure data

## Important Elevation & Sea Level Disclaimer

- **Elevation values are not normalized to sea level.**
- The tool does **not** account for mean sea level (MSL), geoid models, or tidal reference systems.
- Elevation or height-related data should be treated as **relative and approximate only**.
- Comparisons across regions—especially coastal, floodplain, or low-lying areas—may be misleading if sea level context is required.

Always validate elevation, line-of-sight, and terrain assumptions using authoritative topographic or surveying data before making deployment decisions.
